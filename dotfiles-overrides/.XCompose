<Multi_key> <l> <t> : "Imagine three different experts are answering this question. All experts will write down 1 step of their thinking, then share it with the group. Then all experts will go on to the next step, etc. If any expert realizes they're wrong at any point then they leave. The question is:"
<Multi_key> <l> <s> : "You are an expert AI assistant that specializes in logical reasoning. When you respond, please think step by step and show your work. First, identify the key components of the problem. Then, work through each component systematically. Finally, synthesize your findings into a clear conclusion."
<Multi_key> <l> <r> : "Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step."
<Multi_key> <l> <f> : "Let's think step by step. I need to work backwards from first principles to solve this problem systematically."
<Multi_key> <l> <d> : "Please critique my reasoning and point out any flaws or gaps in my logic. After providing your critique, offer an improved solution."
<Multi_key> <l> <e> : "Explain this concept at multiple levels: first for a beginner, then for someone with intermediate knowledge, and finally for an expert. What would each group need to know?"
<Multi_key> <l> <a> : "Find analogies in at least two different domains that help explain this concept. Use these analogies to reason about the problem from multiple angles."
<Multi_key> <l> <m> : "Consider this problem from multiple perspectives: What would a [domain expert], a [user], and a [critic] each say about this approach? Synthesize their viewpoints."
<Multi_key> <l> <v> : "Before giving your final answer, please verify your reasoning by: 1) Checking for logical consistency, 2) Testing against edge cases, 3) Considering alternative explanations, 4) Identifying potential sources of error."

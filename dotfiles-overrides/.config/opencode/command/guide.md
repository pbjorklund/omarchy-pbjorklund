# Context

Read the user's problem or question:
- [ ] Read $ARGUMENTS

## Your Task

Guide user through the task one step at a time. Analyze conversation context to understand the task.

Research when needed, provide clear instructions, wait for confirmation between steps.

## Phase 1: Research (when needed)

Use webfetch when encountering:
- Unfamiliar technologies or tools
- Installation or setup procedures
- Current best practices
- Version-specific information
- Error messages or troubleshooting scenarios

Research thoroughly before providing guidance. Synthesize findings into clear, relevant steps.

## Phase 2: Provide Next Step

Use this format for every step:

```
[If research conducted]
**Research:** [Brief key findings that inform this step]

**Step [N]:** [Clear, specific instruction]

**Why:** [Brief context - what this achieves]

**Command/Code:**
[Exact syntax to run or write]

**Expected Result:** [What should happen when successful]

**When ready:** [Proceed prompt or troubleshooting note]
```

### Guidance Examples

**Installation task:**
```
**Research:** Checked official docs - current stable version is 2.5.1, requires Python 3.8+

**Step 1:** Verify Python version

**Why:** Tool requires Python 3.8 or higher

**Command:**
python3 --version

**Expected Result:** Should show "Python 3.8.x" or higher

**When ready:** Tell me the version number you see
```

**Configuration task:**
```
**Step 2:** Create configuration file

**Why:** This defines the service behavior and integrates with existing setup

**Command:**
cat > config/service.conf << 'EOF'
[Service]
enabled=true
port=8080
EOF

**Expected Result:** File created at config/service.conf with those contents

**When ready:** Confirm the file is created, then we'll test the configuration
```

## Phase 3: Troubleshoot When Needed

If user reports error or unexpected result:
1. Ask for exact error message or output
2. Research error if unfamiliar
3. Provide specific fix
4. Re-run step to verify

## Critical Rules

**One step at a time** - Provide only the next immediate action

**Wait for confirmation** - Let user complete each step before continuing

**Never guess** - If uncertain, research or ask for clarification

**Show exact syntax** - Always provide copy-paste ready commands, never "run the install command"

**Evidence-based** - "According to the official docs..." not "I think..."

**Adapt to feedback** - If step fails, adjust guidance based on error

# DisplayLink + Electron fix: DO NOT CHANGE TO 'auto' OR 'wayland'
# After hours debugging SIGILL crashes with USB-C dock monitors:
# - 'auto' tries Wayland first -> DisplayLink virtual displays incompatible with XWayland
# - Results in illegal instruction crashes in all Electron apps (VS Code, Obsidian, etc)
# - Only occurs when DisplayLink monitors active, works fine with native HDMI/DP
# - wlroots compositors have poor DisplayLink integration vs X11/Xorg environments
# - x11 forces stable XWayland path, bypasses broken DisplayLink+Wayland detection
# See: docs/DisplayLink-Wayland-Issue-Analysis.md for full forensic details

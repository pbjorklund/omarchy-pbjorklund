# pbjorklund's Omarchy Configuration

Personal customizations for [omarchy](https://omarchy.org) that preserve omarchy's update compatibility.

## Overview

This setup adds development tools, applications, and personal dotfiles to omarchy while maintaining compatibility with upstream updates. The override strategy differs by configuration type:

- **Hyprland configs**: Sourced by omarchy's main configs to allow upstream updates
- **Other dotfiles**: Symlinked via GNU Stow to override defaults

## Structure

- `overrides/` - Install scripts sourced by `install.sh`
- `dotfiles-overrides/` - Personal dotfiles deployed via Stow
- `applications/` - Custom desktop files
- `bin/` - Utility scripts

## Prerequisites

1. Complete omarchy installation from https://omarchy.org
2. Set up 1Password SSH agent:
   - Import SSH key named "pbjorklund-ssh"
   - Enable SSH agent in Settings â†’ Developer

## Installation

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd omarchy-pbjorklund
./install.sh
```

The install script sources each override script in sequence, with error handling and retry instructions on failure.

## Post-Installation

1. Configure keyring: `seahorse`
2. Connect Tailscale: `sudo tailscale up --login-server=https://headscale.pbjorklund.com`

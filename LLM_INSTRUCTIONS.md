# Arch Linux Desktop Setup - LLM Instructions

## MUST Follow
- Use `set -e` in new scripts
- Use `source` not `bash` in install.sh
- No interactive prompts
- Test on fresh Arch VM before committing

## Output Style Guidelines (Match Omarchy)
- **NO EMOJIS** - omarchy uses clean text only
- **Minimal output** - focus on essential progress messages
- **Silent scripts** - individual sourced scripts should be mostly quiet
- **Clean messaging**: Use format like "Installing personal applications" not "ðŸŽ¨ Installing additional applications..."
- **Error handling**: Simple, direct error messages without decoration
- **Progress style**: Brief status lines like omarchy's "Installing terminal tools [2/5]"
- **No explanatory text** - avoid verbose descriptions during installation
- **Management commands**: List simply at end, no bullet styling

## Package Rules
- Check pacman before AUR
- Use `yay -S --noconfirm` for AUR
- Flatpak for GUI apps

## Don't Break
- Desktop-only (no laptop features)
- Wayland-first (no X11)
- Script execution order matters

## Key Paths
- Add software to `overrides/apps.sh`
- Config overrides in `overrides/dotfiles.sh`  
- Desktop integration in `overrides/desktop.sh`
- Source new scripts from `install.sh`

## Common Gotchas
- Scripts are sourced, not executed (affects variable scope)
- No rollback mechanism - changes are permanent
- Hardcoded for Arch package names only
- Manual dotfiles deployment required after install
- Security-first mindset - all changes affect system hardening
- AUR packages may fail if mirrors are down
- Single-user system focus
- Error trap catches failures and shows retry instructions

## 1Password SSH Setup Required
The install script configures Git to use SSH with 1Password's SSH agent. You must:
1. Install 1Password desktop app from https://1password.com/downloads/linux/
2. Import your SSH key with the name specified in config.env into 1Password
3. Enable SSH agent in 1Password â†’ Settings â†’ Developer â†’ "Use the SSH agent"
4. Restart terminal after running install script for SSH_AUTH_SOCK to take effect
